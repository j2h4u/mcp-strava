# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-20)

**Core value:** Preserve the local Strava mirror and keep trusted training analytics working while the service is refactored into clean core, repository, adapter, CLI, and MCP boundaries.
**Current focus:** Phase 5 — mcp http surface & docker hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 5
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Start with package/settings boundary before deeper adapter/MCP work.
- Phase 2: Treat `data/strava.db` as durable state with mandatory backup/preflight/parity checks.
- Phase 5: Keep MCP read-only and exclude sync/admin/debug capability surface.
- [Phase 01]: Established src/mcp_strava package boundary and module entrypoint via python -m mcp_strava
- [Phase 01]: Deferred console executable remains enforced with no [project.scripts] entry
- [Phase 02]: Runtime paths no longer execute schema-changing DDL; migration gate owns schema changes.
- [Phase 02]: Expected mirror DB open now fails closed with sqlite URI mode=rw.
- [Phase 02]: Repository boundary implemented with focused methods and AST direct-sqlite guard.
- [Phase 02]: Plan 02-04 enforces explicit DB safety commands and repository-backed sync writes.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Requirement-to-implementation mapping must preserve data and avoid accidental empty-DB bootstrap behavior during refactor.
